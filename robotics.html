        <h1>Robotics</h1>
        <p>I joined robotics in grade 9, I was very skeptical at first but I gave it a try. I stuck with it even when it got tough, and I love it so much. I decided to continue with it this year, and was given many important roles. I can't wait to gain so many new experiences and make so many new memories. I plan to keep doing robotics all throughout my highschool career.</p>
