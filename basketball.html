        <p>I did not start playing basketball until I was in grade 6, but even though I was inexperienced I made a rep team. I played basketball the next two years and loved it. Once I started doing robotics, I didn't have any time to play basketball. I still play basketball for fun and watch the NBA with my family and friends.</p>
